Open a browser and launch the WDC simulator with the following url: 

```ruby
http://localhost:8888/Simulator/index.html
```

In the WDC URL field, enter the path to the WDC relative to the simulator. In this example, we have put the indexLO.html and MongoCnt.js files into “Examples/TestMftTableauCntFLG”.

Use the web data connector with Tableau Desktop
Open Tableau Desktop and select the “Web Data Connector” entry. 
Your files (html and java scripts) must be into the WDC directory.
In the WDC URL field, enter the path of your indexLO.html file. The path must be relative to the WDC directory. For example, if you have created them into “webdataconnector/Examples/TestMftTableauCnt”, you might enter: localhost:8888/Examples/TestMftTableauCnt/indexLO.html
 

Then enter the number of data to get (max 1000 in this sample).

 
Tableau will display the columns to be filled. Then click on “Update Now”.
 

Tableau will load your data through Live Objects API.
 

You can then view and analyze your data
