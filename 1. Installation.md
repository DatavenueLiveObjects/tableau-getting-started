# Install software #
In order to be familiar with Tableau web data connectors and how to create one, please follow the Tableau tutorial :

[Tableau tutorial](http://tableau.github.io/webdataconnector/docs/)

and install the prerequisites (git, node, npm, the simulator tool).

Notice that you **need a Device Simulator** to test your web data connector and run your sample (html/JS file) in production in a web server.

If you have none, you can use our Android Device Simulator

# Android Device Simulator of Live Objects #

You can use the MQTT simulator Live Objects provides on Android phone.

First you can [download it on Google Play.](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.orange.lo.assetdemo)

After installation you will find it under "LO Asset" name.

To use the simulator you need a Live Objects API key.

If you do not have a Live Objects account, you can get a 1 year free account on that page : https://liveobjects.orange-business.com/#/request_account

You can create an API Key in "Configuration" tab , then "Api keys" section.
Click on "Add an API key"

You have to enter 
* the Name of your key
* Its profile : for the simulator you select "MQTT device"
* then click on Create

You will get your API key. *Important : you have to keep it, Live Objects won't display it again if you lose it.*
